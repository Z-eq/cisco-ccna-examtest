  "correct": "When the core and the distribution layer are merged into one layer.",
  "category": "Network Architecture",
  "explanation": "A **collapsed core architecture** is a two-tier network design common in smaller to mid-sized campus networks. It is created by **merging the Core and Distribution layers** of the traditional three-tier hierarchical model into a single layer. This approach simplifies the topology, reduces equipment costs, and lowers latency while retaining the key functions of both layers, such as high-speed switching (Core) and policy enforcement/routing aggregation (Distribution). The **Access layer** remains separate."

  "category": "Cisco Routing Concepts",
  "explanation": "Administrative Distance (AD) is a value used by a Cisco router to determine the preferred path to a destination when the router learns the same route from two or more different routing sources (e.g., OSPF, EIGRP, Static Route). A lower AD value indicates a more trustworthy or believable source. The AD is locally significant to the router."

  ],
  "correct": "backup",
  "category": "Switching",
  "explanation": "In Rapid PVST+ (which uses RSTP principles), the **Backup port** role is unique because it only exists in multi-access networks (like those using a shared segment, although this is rare in modern Ethernet). A Backup port is a port that connects to the same segment as the **Designated port** on the **same switch**. It provides a redundant connection to that segment. \n\n* If the Designated port fails, the Backup port immediately takes over and transitions to the **Forwarding** state.\n* It is always in the **Discarding** state in the active topology.\n\nThis role is distinct from the **Alternate port**, which provides a redundant path to the root bridge via a *different* switch."

  ],
  "correct": "errdisable",
  "category": "Switching",
  "explanation": "The primary function of **BPDU Guard** is to protect the integrity of the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) root path by shutting down ports that are not expected to receive BPDUs. When a port is configured with **PortFast** (meaning it's expected to connect only to an end device like a PC) and receives a BPDU from an adjacent switch, BPDU Guard immediately transitions the port into the **errdisable** state. In the errdisable state, the port is logically shut down and requires manual intervention (or automated recovery) to become active again."

    "category": "Routing/OSPF",
    "explanation": "Link-state protocols (like OSPF) send an **update (LSA) only when a topological change occurs**, not the entire routing table. Segmenting the network into areas (OSPF) also limits the scope of flooding, but the principle of sending only change updates is fundamental."

The task requires denying the entire 172.16.0.0/16 network and permitting everything else.\n\n1.  **Deny Statement:** The network 172.16.0.0/16 translates to the IP address **172.16.0.0** and the wildcard mask **0.0.255.255** (the inverse of the subnet mask 255.255.0.0).

  "category": "IPv6 Addressing",
  "explanation": "The EUI-64 process converts the 48-bit MAC address into a 64-bit Interface ID by inserting 'FFFE' and then modifying the 7th bit (the Universal/Local bit) of the first octet. This means:\n\n1.  **network interface card (NIC) specific octets:** The last 24 bits of the MAC address are used entirely **unchanged** in the resulting Interface ID.\n2.  **the unicast/multicast bit:** This is the 8th bit of the first octet. It is *not* the bit that is inverted during the EUI-64 process, so it remains **unchanged**.\n\nConversely, the **universal/local bit** is intentionally **inverted**, which also changes the value of the overall **Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI) octets**."
