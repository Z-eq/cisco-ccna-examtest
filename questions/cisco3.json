      "by distributing the footprint of DDoS attacks",
      "by verifying the reachability of the source address in packets sent forward",
      "by monitoring connection states and maintaining a state table",
      "by monitoring interface packet counters"
    ],
    "correct": "by verifying the reachability of the source address in packets sent forward",
    "category": "Security and Routing",
    "explanation": "uRPF (Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding) mitigates DoS/DDoS attacks by verifying that the source IP address of an incoming packet is reachable via the same interface it arrived on (the Reverse Path check). \nIf the path is invalid, the packet is considered spoofed and is dropped. \nThis blocks forged source addresses."

    "question": "A router has learned three possible routes that can be used to reach a destination network. These routes have been learned by three different routing protocols: OSPF, EIGRP and RIPv2. Which route will the router install in the routing table?",
    "options": [
      "EIGRP route",
      "OSPF route",
      "RIPv2",
      "all three routes",
      "default route"
    ],
    "correct": "EIGRP route",
    "category": "Routing/AD",
    "explanation": "Cisco chooses the best route based on the lowest **Administrative Distance (AD)**. EIGRP (AD 90) has a lower AD than OSPF (AD 110) and RIPv2 (AD 120), so the EIGRP route is installed."

    "explanation": "VRRP (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) is an open standard FHRP that allows multiple routers to provide redundancy for a default gateway. Unlike HSRP, which is Cisco proprietary, VRRP can include more than two routers to increase fault tolerance. ARP and DHCP are unrelated protocols, and GLBP is Cisco proprietary."

      "Unlike static routing, dynamic routing enables routers to select paths for non real-time network changes.",

      "Dynamic routing protocols keep the routes permanently (like static), even though there are changes in network."

      "Dynamic routing protocols automatically adjust routes when the topology or traffic changes."
    ],
    "category": "Routing",
    "explanation": "Correct: Dynamic routing protocols allow routers to discover new networks by exchanging updates and automatically adjust routes when topology or traffic changes. Alternatives:\n- 'Unable to make changes' is false; dynamic protocols update the routing table.\n- 'Select paths for non real-time changes' is misleading; they respond to actual topology changes.\n- 'Install a default route to discover neighbors' is incorrect; neighbors are discovered via hello messages, not default routes.\n- 'Keep routes permanently like static' is false; dynamic routes can change."

  ],
  "correct": "DHCP timeout",
  "category": "Cisco Switching",
  "explanation": "The primary purpose of configuring **PortFast** on a Cisco switch port is to eliminate the delay associated with the Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) transitioning a port through its listening and learning states. When a host (like a PC or server) connects to a port, it expects immediate network access to acquire an IP address via DHCP. Without PortFast, the delay (up to 50 seconds in classic STP) can cause the host's DHCP request to time out before the port enters the forwarding state, thus failing to acquire an address. PortFast immediately moves the port to the **forwarding** state, solving the **DHCP timeout** issue for end-devices."

    "question": "What are the three core layers of a typical Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architecture? (Choose three.)",

  ],
  "correct": [
    "application",
    "control",
    "infrastructure"
  ],
  "category": "Network Fundamentals",
  "explanation": "SDN fundamentally separates the network control logic from the physical forwarding devices. The architecture is defined by three distinct layers:\n\n1.  **Application Layer:** The top layer where network services and business logic reside. This layer communicates *what* the network should do (e.g., security policies, load balancing, traffic engineering). It interacts with the Control Layer using Northbound APIs (typically RESTful APIs).\n2.  **Control Layer:** The central 'brain' of the SDN architecture, typically a centralized controller. It translates the high-level policies received from the Application Layer into specific, low-level instructions and forwarding rules for the hardware. It maintains a centralized view of the entire network.\n3.  **Infrastructure Layer (Data Plane):** The bottom layer, consisting of the actual network devices (switches, routers, firewalls). These devices execute the instructions received from the Control Layer using Southbound APIs (like OpenFlow or NETCONF). Their sole function is the physical forwarding of data traffic.\n\nThe options 'network' and 'presentation' are layers found in the traditional OSI model, not the SDN model."
