    "category": "Routing",
    "explanation": "OSPF uses 'Cost' as its metric. The cost is inversely related to the link's bandwidth, meaning higher bandwidth links have a lower (better) cost. The best path is the one with the lowest total accumulated cost."

  "correct": "startup-config is copied to RAM when the switch is booted",
  "category": "Switching Fundamentals",
  "explanation": "When a Cisco device (switch or router) boots up, the device locates the saved configuration file, **startup-config** (which resides in non-volatile memory, **NVRAM**), and copies it into **RAM**. Once loaded into RAM, it becomes the **running-config**, which the device actively uses to operate."
