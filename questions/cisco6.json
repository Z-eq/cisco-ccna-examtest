This results in the switch reporting an increasing number of **FCS Errors** (Frame Check Sequence failures) and **Runts** (frames smaller than 64 bytes).\n2.  **Half-Duplex Side (Client):** The client must run CSMA/CD. When the full-duplex switch sends traffic at any time, it causes collisions on the client side, forcing the client to continuously retransmit packets, leading to poor throughput and wasted bandwidth."

  "category": "IPv6 Addressing",
  "explanation": "Unique Local Addresses (ULA) are intended for communication within a limited administrative domain, such as a private network or an organization's site, and are not routable on the public internet.\n\n1.  **Site-Local:** This is the historical term that ULA (FC00::/7) was introduced to replace. It describes the scope of routing within a single, defined location or site.\n2.  **Organization-Local:** While not a formally defined scope in the same way as link-local or global, it accurately describes the intended use and scope of ULA—to be routable only within the bounds of a single organization."

    "An SSID must be advertised by the Wi-Fi access point.",
    "An SSID is configured by default on an access point."
  ],
  "correct": "An administrator can create several SSIDs on the same access point.",
  "category": "Wireless Networking",
  "explanation": "Modern Access Points (APs), especially those in enterprise environments (Cisco WLC and APs), support the creation of multiple Virtual APs (VAPs) which correspond to different SSIDs. Each SSID can be mapped to a separate VLAN, allowing different security policies (e.g., guest vs. employee access) and network services to be applied while using the same physical hardware."
