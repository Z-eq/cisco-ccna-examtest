In the errdisable state, the port is logically shut down and requires manual intervention (or automated recovery) to become active again."

Without PortFast, the delay (up to 50 seconds in classic STP) can cause the host's DHCP request to time out before the port enters the forwarding state, thus failing to acquire an address.

This log, which includes the user, the time, and the resource accessed, provides crucial **visibility** for security teams, ensures non-repudiation, helps maintain compliance, and is vital data for any forensic analysis following an incident.

        "category": "Routing Protocols (OSPF/EIGRP)",
        "explanation": "The command used to manually configure the **Router ID** for a routing process (such as OSPF or EIGRP) on a Cisco router is `router-id ip-address`. This command is executed within the specific **router configuration mode** (e.g., `config-router`) for the routing protocol being configured. Manually configuring the Router ID ensures predictability and stability in the routing domain."

        "category": "Routing Protocols (OSPF/EIGRP)",
        "explanation": "Link-state routing protocols like OSPF use Dijkstra's algorithm, commonly referred to as the **Shortest Path First (SPF)** algorithm, to analyze the LSDB and compute the shortest, loop-free path to every network destination."
