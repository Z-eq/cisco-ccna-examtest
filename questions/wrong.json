    ],
    "category": "Wireless",
    "explanation": "The correct answers are centralized and standalone. When an AP is configured as centralized, all the traffic goes through the Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC), which is not the case with standalone APs. The basic premise of a Wi-Fi Direct deployment is the creation of peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connections between devices, without the need for an AP. It is another example of a wireless personal area network (WPAN). ZTP is a process of automatically configuring network equipment."

    "correct": "filtering of traffic to control access to network services",
    "category": "Access Control Lists (ACL)",
    "explanation": "Access Control Lists (ACLs) are primarily used to filter traffic based on criteria like source/destination IP, port number, or protocol, thereby controlling access to specific network resources and services."

      "Permit all noninitial fragments.",
      "Permit RFC 1918 IPv4 address space.",
      "Implement ingress filtering according to RFC 2827.",

    "category": "Access Control Lists (ACL)",
    "explanation": "An Infrastructure ACL (iACL) should deny malformed packets (non-initial fragments), implement ingress filtering (anti-spoofing via RFC 2827) to block traffic from the Internet with internal source addresses, and explicitly permit legitimate management traffic to infrastructure devices."

    "explanation": "För **HSRP version 1** är formatet för den virtuella MAC-adressen `0000.0C07.ACxx`, där `xx` är HSRP-gruppnumret i hexadecimalt format. Eftersom gruppnumret är **10**, blir det hexadecimalt **0A**. Den fullständiga MAC-adressen är därför **0000.0C07.AC0A**."

      "disable auto-negotiation on both sides of the link and manually configure full-duplex on both sides of the link",

    ],
    "correct": "enable auto-negotiation on both sides of the link",
    "category": "Network Fundamentals & Tools",
    "explanation": "Auto-negotiation is the standard best practice for modern networks, including Fast Ethernet, to ensure both sides of the link correctly agree on the highest common speed and duplex setting, thus preventing mismatch issues."
