        "explanation": "In EUI-64, the 48-bit MAC is split, and 'FFFE' is inserted. The **NIC-specific octets (the last 24 bits of the MAC)** are used directly. The **universal/local bit** (the seventh bit of the MAC's first octet) is **inverted**, meaning the OUI octets **are changed**. The **unicast/multicast bit** (the eighth bit of the MAC's first octet) is used as part of the OUI but is not typically considered separately in this context, the entire 24-bit NIC portion is used unchanged."
