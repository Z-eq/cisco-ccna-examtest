    "explanation": "A duplex mismatch (one side Full, the other Half) causes severe communication problems:\n\n1.  **Full-Duplex Side (Switch):** Since the switch sends and receives simultaneously without running CSMA/CD, when the half-duplex client sends data while the switch is also transmitting, the switch receives fragmented or garbled packets. This results in the switch reporting an increasing number of **FCS Errors** (Frame Check Sequence failures) and **Runts** (frames smaller than 64 bytes).\n2.  **Half-Duplex Side (Client):** The client must run CSMA/CD. When the full-duplex switch sends traffic at any time, it causes collisions on the client side, forcing the client to continuously retransmit packets, leading to poor throughput and wasted bandwidth."

    "explanation": "Unique Local Addresses (ULA) are intended for communication within a limited administrative domain, such as a private network or an organization's site, and are not routable on the public internet.\n\n1.  **Site-Local:** This is the historical term that ULA (FC00::/7) was introduced to replace. It describes the scope of routing within a single, defined location or site.\n2.  **Organization-Local:** While not a formally defined scope in the same way as link-local or global, it accurately describes the intended use and scope of ULA—to be routable only within the bounds of a single organization."

In the modified EUI-64 format, the 48-bit MAC address is split, and the constant 'FFFE' is inserted in the middle. The universal/local bit (the seventh bit of the MAC address) is inverted. As this bit is part of the OUI octets, inverting it changes the value of the OUI octets as well."
