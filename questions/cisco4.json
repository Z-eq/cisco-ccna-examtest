Disabling DTP and setting ports manually prevents this.\n2.  **Explicitly configure trunking mode or access mode:** Ports connected to end devices (hosts) should be explicitly set to **access mode** (`switchport mode access`) to prevent them from becoming trunks.

        "explanation": "The 802.1Q standard inserts a 4-byte Tag into the Ethernet frame. While the Tag contains two main functional fields (TPID/EtherType and VLAN ID), the **VLAN ID** (a 12-bit sub-field) is the unique identifier that specifically enables the separation and forwarding of traffic based on VLAN membership. It is the core functional component that the 802.1Q process adds to the frame to implement network segmentation."

        "category": "Wireless",
        "explanation": "Cisco Mobility Express is a controller-less solution designed primarily for Small to Midsize Businesses (SMBs). Its main benefit is the **reduced initial cost** because it eliminates the need to purchase a dedicated physical Wireless LAN Controller (WLC). Instead, one of the Access Points (APs) assumes the role of the master controller, managing the other APs in the network. Features like multiple SSIDs, VLANs, and QoS are standard capabilities across most modern Cisco wireless solutions, regardless of whether a separate controller is used."

This log, containing the user, the resource, and a timestamp, is essential for security auditing, compliance, and forensic analysis in the event of a security breach or misuse. Centralized password management is actually preferred for consistency and scalability, despite the single point of failure risk, which is mitigated through redundancy."

In a wireless environment, it enhances security by:\n\n1.  **Individualized Login (Authentication & Authorization):** RADIUS validates each user's credentials against a central database (like Active Directory) rather than relying on a single, shared Pre-Shared Key (PSK). This allows the network to assign unique access policies (Authorization) and track actions (Accounting) to **specific network devices or users**, which is critical for security auditing and ensuring accountability.\n2.  **Centralization:** Using RADIUS (802.1X Enterprise Mode) means that changing one person's access or credentials only requires an update to the central server, not every Access Point (AP) in the network."

        "explanation": "In an MPLS L3VPN (Layer 3 VPN) service, the service provider's router (PE) participates in IP routing with the customer's router (CE). This means the customer sees the provider's network as a router that handles the routing function between sites. If the answer were L2VPN or VPLS, the provider network would appear as a switch (a transparent Layer 2 segment)."
