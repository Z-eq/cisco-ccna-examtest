Quiz App: Knowledge Tester

 Features

    Dynamic Selection: Choose exactly which JSON files (categories) you want to be tested on.

    Clear Progress: Features a visible progress bar and clear question numbering (e.g., "Question 5 of 10").

    Detailed Highscores: Saves highscores including score, total time, date, time of completion, and the categories included in the test.

    Flexible Question Types: Supports both single-choice and multi-select (multiple correct answers) questions.

    Practice Mode: Automatically saves incorrectly answered questions, allowing you to run a dedicated test focusing only on your "wrong answers".

🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.
1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project to your computer:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourProjectName.git
cd YourProjectName

2. Install Python Dependencies

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment (venv) to isolate the project's dependencies.
a. Create and Activate Environment
Bash

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# Windows (Command Prompt/PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

b. Install Packages

Use the requirements.txt file to install Flask and its dependencies:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Add Question Files

The application reads questions from the questions/ directory.

    Create your own JSON files (e.g., questions/science.json or questions/history.json).

    The format must match the structure the app expects (see example below).

    Example JSON Structure (for a file inside questions/):
    JSON

    [
      {
        "question": "What is the capital of Sweden?",
        "options": ["Malmö", "Gothenburg", "Stockholm", "Uppsala"],
        "correct": "Stockholm",
        "explanation": "Stockholm has been the capital of Sweden since the Middle Ages.",
        "category": "Geography"
      }
    ]

4. Run the Application

Ensure your virtual environment is active (Step 2), then run the application:
Bash

python app.py

The application will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
